Utility for converting searched mass spec data into a format readable by CAMV.

## Installation

To install the core pyproteome package, run the following command:

```
pip install pycamverter
```

### Windows

If you are using Windows, it is easiest to use the latest version of
[Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) for your Python installation, as
pyproteome requires several hard-to-install packages, such as NumPy and SciPy.

Then, you can simply run the above `pip install pycamverter` command to install
this package and the rest of its dependencies.
